## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do


## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector"
## which is really a list containing a function to

## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse matrix of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse matrix has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse matrix from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse matrix of the data and sets the value of the inverse matrix in the cache via
## the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  s <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  s
}
